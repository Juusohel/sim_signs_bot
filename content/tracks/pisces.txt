The stars have chosen Circuit Paul Ricard!

Pisces are sensitive and with massive runoff areas and not a wall in sight, Paul Ricard is the perfect track to fulfil their need for safety and stability.
Pisces are also emotional creatures, and the blue color scheme, promoting calmness and serenity is perfect for them.
